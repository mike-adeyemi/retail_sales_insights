Mockup
The dashboard layout follows best practices for usability, featuring:
â€¢	A clean, intuitive layout
â€¢	Filters and slicers for dynamic analysis
â€¢	Visual elements highlighting key insights
Tools
|Tool|	Purpose|
|SQL Server	|Data Cleaning & Storage|
|Power BI|	Data Visualization|
|Excel	|Initial Data Exploration|
|GitHub|	Project Documentation & Version Control|

Development
Pseudocode
1.	Load data from SQL Server into Power BI.
2.	Clean the data (handle missing values, correct data types, etc.).
3.	Create relationships between tables for accurate reporting.
4.	Develop Power BI visuals and dashboards.
5.	Apply DAX measures for KPI calculations.
6.	Perform testing and validation.
7.	Publish dashboard and document insights.

Data Exploration & Cleaning
â€¢	Removed null values in key performance fields.
â€¢	Ensured all columns have appropriate data types.
â€¢	Checked for and removed duplicate records.
â€¢	Retained only relevant columns.

Transforming the Data
SQL Query to Clean Data:
SELECT
    Branch,
    Product,
    Category,
    SUM(Sales) AS Total_Sales,
    SUM(Profit) AS Total_Profit,
    COUNT(Transaction_ID) AS Total_Transactions
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY Branch, Product, Category;
Creating the SQL View
CREATE VIEW sales_summary AS
SELECT
    Branch,
    Product,
    Category,
    SUM(Sales) AS Total_Sales,
    SUM(Profit) AS Total_Profit,
    COUNT(Transaction_ID) AS Total_Transactions
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY Branch, Product, Category;

Testing & Data Quality Checks
Row Count Validation:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM sales_summary;
Column Count Validation:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS column_count FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'sales_summary';
Visualization & Results
â€¢	Total Revenue & Profit Trends
â€¢	Top-Selling Products by Revenue & Quantity
â€¢	Customer Segmentation & Buying Patterns
â€¢	Branch Performance Analysis

DAX Measures
Total Sales = SUM(sales_summary[Total_Sales])
Total Profit = SUM(sales_summary[Total_Profit])
Avg Sales per Transaction = DIVIDE([Total Sales], COUNT(sales_summary[Total_Transactions]))

Analysis & Findings
1.	Top-Selling Products: The highest revenue-generating products were from the Electronics category.
2.	Branch Performance: The Downtown branch had the highest sales volume, but the Uptown branch had the highest average profit per sale.
3.	Customer Insights: Repeat customers contribute over 60% of total revenue, suggesting strong brand loyalty.

Validation & Discovery
â€¢	Revenue trends showed seasonal fluctuations, with peak sales in Q4.
â€¢	Certain product categories had high returns, impacting profitability.

Recommendations
1.	Stock More High-Demand Products: Increase stock levels for the most profitable items.
2.	Focus on Repeat Customers: Implement targeted promotions for high-value customers.
